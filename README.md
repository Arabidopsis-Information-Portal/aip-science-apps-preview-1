Overview
========

The preview release of Araport uses the Homebox module in Drupal to provide a portlet-based configurable Science Apps view. The included files represent the content of Drupal blocks configured to work with Homeobox and are named according to the Science App they power. 

Remote web services accessed by various apps are currently being proxied directly by the Araport server to avoid cross-domain scripting security violations. In the future, these web services be exposed via a separate AIP-hosted API manager. 

*If you are interested in developing science apps with us, please don't use these as examples. Instead, contact us at support@araport.org*
