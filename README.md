Overview
========

The Preview 2 release of Araport uses the Homebox module in Drupal to provide a portlet-based configurable Science Apps view. The included files represent the content of Drupal blocks configured to work with Homeobox and are named according to the Science App they power. 

The Araport Science Apps model assumes that remote web services are registered with the Araport API manager at https://api.araport.org/store/

*If you are interested in developing science apps with us, please don't use these as examples. Instead, contact us at support@araport.org*
